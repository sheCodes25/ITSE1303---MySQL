a) Get the numbers of the teams of which the player with the name Parmenter and initial R is a member; in this example, we assume that no two players have the same name and initials.

SELECT   TEAMNO
FROM     TEAMS
WHERE    PLAYERNO =
        (SELECT   PLAYERNO
         FROM     PLAYERS
         WHERE    NAME = 'Parmenter'
         AND      INITIALS = 'R')

output:
TEAMNO
1





b)For each penalty, find the payment number, the amount, and the number and name of the player who incurred it.

sql:
SELECT   PAYMENTNO, AMOUNT, PLAYERS.PLAYERNO, NAME
FROM     PENALTIES, PLAYERS
WHERE    PENALTIES.PLAYERNO = PLAYERS.PLAYERNO

output:
PAYMENTNO	AMOUNT	   PLAYERNO	NAME
1		100.00	   6		Parmenter
2		75.00	   44		Baker
3		100.00	   27		Collins

c)For all players, get the player number and a list of the numbers of teams for which they have ever played.


sql:
SELECT   P.PLAYERNO, M.TEAMNO
FROM     PLAYERS AS P LEFT OUTER JOIN MATCHES AS M
         ON P.PLAYERNO = M.PLAYERNO

output:
PLAYERNO	TEAMNO
6		1
6		1
6		1
44		1
83		1
2		1
57		1
8		1
27		2
104		2
